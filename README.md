App for cameramans coordination during multicam shooting.

It's often a situation during multicam session, when some of the cameramens decide to change their shooting plane simultaneously. In this case, later, in time of editing, video editor has no correct takes to choose... For preventing this stuff, i've developed this project.

React and Redux was used for implementaton. Also Google kindly has provided it's Firebase Reatime Database, wich fits best for this project, and it even don't requires backend, so, it's almost "serverless" :)

It can be tested here: [MCTally](https://ediss0n.github.io/mctally/)
